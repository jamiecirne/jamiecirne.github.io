		One of his most famous series, Homage to the Square, explored the relationship between color, shape, and the spatial relationships created by color. In 1965, he wrote of the series: “They all are of different palettes, and, therefore, so to speak, of different climates. Choice of the colours used, as well as their order, is aimed at an interaction - influencing and changing each other forth and back. Thus, character and feeling alter from painting to painting without any additional ‘hand writing’ or, so-called, texture. Though the underlying symmetrical and quasi-concentric order of squares remains the same in all paintings – in proportion and placement – these same squares group or single themselves, connect and separate in many different ways.”

		Josef Albers was a German-born painter, sculptor, and teacher who was instrumental in bringing ideals of the Bauhaus to America. A professor at the Bauhaus, he left Germany in 1933 for the United States. Albers’s theories were widely shared and ‘provided the theoretical basis for development of non-objective are during and after the age of Abstract Expressionism” (The Art Story.) Albers’s book, Interaction of Color, profoundly influenced art and art education in the 20th century.
