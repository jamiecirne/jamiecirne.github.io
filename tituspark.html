	<h1 id="titussparrow">Titus Sparrow</h1>
	<div id="text1">Titus Sparrow was a devoted tennis player who was deeply involved in his community. He began tennis programs for children at nearby Carter Fieldas well as forming the Sportsmen’s Tennis Club , which for decades has provided city children with the opportunity to learn the game at no cost. In 1956, he became the first African-American umpire of the United States Tennis Association. He passed away before the park was ever completed, so they named it, as well as a tennis court, in his honor.</div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	<h1 id="racism">Racism</h1>
	<div id="textbox1">In the 1960’s the houses which used to reside where Titus Sparrow Park now stands had been primarily owned by African-Americans. They possessed job security, which was rare for African-Americans in those days. The city did not lend aid to the area for beneficial development.</div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	<h1 id="urbanrenewal">"Urban Renewal"</h1>
	<div id="textbox2">Homeowners in the area of the park were repeatedly threatened by urban renewal projects that were to “improve” the major entrances to the South End, one of which was West Newton Street. “Improve” meant using federal money to tear down buildings and waiting for allocation of local development funds to rebuild.</div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	<h1 id="classism">Classism</h1>
	<div id="textbox3">In 1967, the houses on that land were torn down, but the city did not want to allocate any money to rebuilding anything in that area due to it being low-income.</div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	<h1 id="highway">Highway</h1>
	<div id="textbox4">The city had plans to build a highway that would bring thousands of more cars into the area. Many did not want this to be build in the neighborhood, but were ignored. Eventually, the three-year battle against the South End Bypass ended in 1972 when Governor Francis Sargent canceled construction plans for highways into and through Boston.</div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	<h1 id="poverty">Poverty</h1>
	<div id="textbox5">The surrounding four neighborhoods (Claremont, Cosmopolitan, St. Botolph, and Pilot Block) decided to band together with the Union United Methodist Church to design the park. The city agreed but did not dedicate much money to it.</div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	<h1 id="gentrification">Gentrification</h1>
	<div id="textbox6">In 2004-2005, after nearly 30 years of intensive use, the Boston Parks Department gave Titus Sparrow Park a major rehabilitation. The basic design stayed the same, with new play equipment, addition of a performance area and new grass, plantings, benches, and court surfaces. The cost of living in the area has increased dramatically since the park's conception.</div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
