				<h3><i>Ponder</i> is the title of my senior year capstone project. I was interested in exploring the state of data privacy within our current reality. Our goal was to uncover which types of data teenagers in particular have on their minds, as well as to encourage everyone to have these very possible scenarios on their mind as they traverse the internet. I was personally responsible for the design look and feel of the project, as well as creating the graphics and styles we used. I mainly worked in Illustrator and InDesign, as well as Figma.
