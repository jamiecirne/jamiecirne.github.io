	<div id="textbox">Stonewall Inn was a mafia-owned gay bar in Greenwich Village, NYC. On June 28th, 1969, the New York City police raided the bar, which triggered a riot amongst its patrons. The police arrested some of the people for wearing clothes that did not match their gender. Angry neighborhood residents stood around outside the bar protesting the arrest and the police got aggressive. When one officer hit a woman on the head as he was arresting her, she shouted for the onlookers to act, triggering the crowd to throw whatever they had on hand at the cops, including rocks.</div>
	<div id="textbox">The Stonewall uprising was an inciting incident that led many LGBT individuals to participate more in political activism. As a result, many organizations were founded such as <a href="https://www.glaad.org/">GLAAD</a> and <a href="https://www.hrc.org/">Human Rights Campaign.</a></div>
